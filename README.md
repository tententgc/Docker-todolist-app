Sure, here's a sample `README.md` file for the `Dockerized-Todo-List-App-with-Kubernetes` GitHub repository:

# Dockerized Todo List App with Kubernetes

This is a sample project for deploying a Todo List application using Docker and Kubernetes. The application is a simple web-based Todo List that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy this application, you'll need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- kubectl

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tententgc/Dockerized-Todo-List-App-with-Kubernetes.git
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```
   docker build -t todo-list-app .
   ```

3. Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

  ```
    kubectl apply -f mongo-configmap.yaml
    kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml
    kubectl apply -f os-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f os-service.yaml
   ```

   This will create a Kubernetes deployment with one pod running the Todo List application.


1. Access the application:

   You can access the Todo List application by navigating to the IP address of the Kubernetes service. For example:

   ```
   http://<service-ip-address>
   ```

   You can find the IP address of the service by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl get services
   ```
